# Detection dangerous items of AI

One idea for detection dangerous items in one room

## Summary

It will do check in one room and it will detected the dangerous items in one room. Mainly items can hurt people. it will have one camera for detected the dangerous items in a room 


## Background

The idea has assist on detected dangerous items in one room. The problem is the not safety places where are people go and with kids them, Also the are people that they have a dangerous items and they go inside in one place with another people and with kids. Naturally we don't know the people goal. The motivation for the idea is the murders that do late night in rooms from people in people that not wait and in road. This is important issue because the more from them events i'ts not easy detect immediately.

### problems

* No check the places are they safety
* No check the people that they going to places and rooms with another people and people with kids them


## How is it used?

The solution has used for people protect. The system there are in every room that thesis there are danger from another people. For example in one mini market. The system has check the people who come inside to mini market. it could to detection for dangerous items so that avoiding the danger and the robbery. The solustion used in one enviroment with kids and one enviroment with payments. For successful this we must receive in consideration what species room is this and the users is the security and police. The users has check the plans and scans from people and the ask for this items the people that have items.


## Data sources and AI methods

The data has collected from machines from scan and from cameras. The system has training from this data and collect the data from check. Basically we collect data with API and next we send a data to security and police.

## Challenges

The project does not solve the direct people help. namely when detection one dangerous item is not notify directly because the check it must detailed check and for goal use item. In addition for the cameras side there are some limitations per continent and country found. for example in europe we dont put cameras in rooms without permission because we have a GDPR law. One ethical consideration that must should be taken is the fear feel. the system is not regognition one situation wherever are fear in people. The fear detection it could with cameras with detection face from people. from this we detection the fear in people in one room. 


## What next?

The project could regognition robber. for this we need one database with robber faces wherever the AI takes the images do comparison and detected the robbers in one room. For this we must fix the system to take data not only from API but and from database wherever there are data from robber and the past from another people and from them.
